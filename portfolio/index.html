    Hey! You can call me Danny. Thanks for passing by. I am a Freelance Web Developer ready to tackle
    any problem Web Programming can solve. I was first introduced to coding thanks to my endless curiosity and obsession with using technology to create innovative services and products. If I placed a bid in one of your posts, be 100% sure that I am totally qualified to do it, always with your best interest in mind and putting my best effort into it. You see, for me, coding is telling a story, one where endless factors are taken into account; it is writing a story to solve a certain problem. The programmer then has to make the best use of its logical and technical skills to write a data story, one that tackles that specific problem; that story is read by a machine which can make calculations at the speed of light, acts based on that story, and voil√†! Another problem was solved thanks to computer and programmers. Isn't that beautiful? I think it is, and that is why I am looking forward to solve any problem within my scope of knowledge and skills. Thanks for your attention! Have a nice day.
